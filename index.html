              <p>In May, 2011, thanks to <a href="http://yesterdayishere.com/now/"><strong>Bojan Janjanin</strong></a>, I had an honor of working with team behind <a href="http://www.amphetamobile.com"><strong>Amphetamobile</strong></a> on their new document management app for iOS.</p>
              <p>When Amphetamobile asked me to help them design their new application, they already had a working prototype of the app and a general idea what they wanted it to become. Together, we took their ideas as a starting point and refined them. As a result, AMMO Rack was featured by Apple in U.S. App Store, among others, for over a week.</p>
              <p>After initial exploring of a few different approaches we decided to go with a rack metaphor. From the start, we wanted to create visual identity that will communicate sturdiness. When used, we wanted for device to become a rack.</p>
              <p>Application would be able to store multiple categories of media, PDFs, photos or books, and we wanted to present that data all upfront, by using rack metaphor where one shelf would present one category we where able to solve that problem.</p>

                  <p>Every category has its own shelf and browsing trough categories is done by swiping left or right. Appearance and behavior communicates that swiping is possible without need of using any progress bar or any other indicator.</p>

              <p>Even though in Edit mode, we can rearrange, add, or even remove entire shelfs. We still wanted to create a quick and delightful way to "hide" those shelfs that we do not want to use or show.</p>
              <p>Guys from Amphetamobile came up with an idea of collapsable shelfs that I really liked and decided to explore further. We wanted to make sure that the solution will be tap friendly and not get in a way of main task which was reading selected documents.</p>
              <p>In the end we created a solution that is available only when needed, while the rest of the time it is neatly tucked out of our way.</p>

              <p>Solutions we designed for reading books, PDFs or viewing photos is something I'm particularly proud off.</p>
              <p>I'm big believer in following the conventions of platform we design for and only once we truly understand all of the rules, only than we can start bending that rules, shaping them for our need, build upon them or even brake them. And that is exactly what we did here.</p>
              <p>Building on foundation of "one shelf equals one category" we designed a way to swap an item without even leaving current screen, without the need to go back on Rack just to select another document.</p>

              <p>Designing Webtrekk application was one of the the most ambitious and challenging projects I've worked on at <a href="http://impaddo.com/en/"><strong>Impaddo</strong></a>. <a href="http://www.webtrekk.com/en/products/q3.html"><strong>Webtrekk Q3</strong></a> is an amazing and tremendous web analytics system, with huge range of filters and analysis functions, and bringing it from desktop to iOS was a particularly exciting challenge.</p>
              <p>Wrangling the amount of content was no trivial pursuit, it was very important to avoid the problem of potential deep level navigation. Like always, I started by creating wireframes for every screen and state with detailed information architecture and documentation. Sketching a wireframe allowed me to quickly and easily explain the ideas behind concepts.</p>
              <p>My favorite part is work done around different ways of showing graphs and tables of data and interactions designed for manipulating them.</p>

                  <h3>Details on trends</h3>
                  <p>Since we were not satisfied by showing just graphs and not details in it, and I didn't want to show a bunch of numbers on some other screen, we came up with an elegant way to show them on current graph.</p>

With that in mind we wanted to create the same ability in our application, but also make sure it's shaped for use on mobile devices.</p>
              <p>Early in process we discovered four most-used periods and offered them right up front while the rest was put one level deeper for easy find but still out of the way.</p>

              <p>We wanted to make sure that reading and viewing articles is as enjoyable as it can be, especially on a mobile device. We think that we succeeded in that. Larger font size, full width images or videos thumbnails are the details that make the difference, invisible at first but noticeable when missing.</p>

                  <h3>Quick browsing through articles</h3>
                  <p>To avoid jumping level up and back down just to read another article, we enabled changing them just by swiping left or right. Page indicator above text indicates which one is currently visible and difference in colors represents read articles from unread.</p>

                  <h3>No distraction while reading</h3>
                  <p>By putting content first we removed all UI distractions right from the start and only after we want to go back to level up, we can call Back button by simply taping anywhere on text.</p>
