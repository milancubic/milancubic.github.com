              <p>In May, 2011, thanks to <a href="http://yesterdayishere.com/now/"><strong>Bojan Janjanin</strong></a>, I had an honor of working with the team behind <a href="http://www.amphetamobile.com"><strong>Amphetamobile</strong></a> on their new document management app for iOS.</p>
              <p>When Amphetamobile asked for my help, they already had a working prototype of the app and a general idea what they wanted it to become. Together, we took their ideas as a starting point and refined them. As a result, AMMO Rack was featured by Apple in U.S. App Store for over a week.</p>
              <p>After initial exploring and reviewing different approaches we decided to go with a rack metaphor. The goal was to create a visual identity that communicates sturdiness. We wanted for the device to become a rack when it is used.</p>
              <p>Application is able to store multiple categories of media, PDFs, photos or books, and we wanted to present that data all upfront. By using a rack metaphor where one shelf presents one category we where able to solve that problem.</p>

                  <p>Every category has its own shelf and browsing is done by swiping left or right. Appearance and behavior of the shelfs communicates that swiping is possible without the need of using any progress bars or any other indicator.</p>

              <p>When in Edit mode we can rearrange, add, or even remove entire shelfs, but we still wanted to create a quick and delightful way to "hide" those shelfs that we do not want to show or use.</p>
              <p>The guys from Amphetamobile had an idea of collapsable shelfs that I really liked and decided to explore further. We wanted to make sure that the solution would be tap friendly and wouldn't get in a way of main tasks.</p>
              <p>In the end, we created a solution that is available only when needed, while the rest of the time it is neatly tucked out of our way.</p>

              <p>Solutions we designed for reading books, PDFs or viewing photos is something I am particularly proud off.</p>
              <p>I am a big believer in following the conventions of platforms we design for. Once we truly understand all of the rules, only than we can start bending that rules, shaping them to our needs, build upon them or even brake them. And that is exactly what we did here.</p>
              <p>Building on foundation of "one shelf equals one category" we designed a way to swap an item without leaving the current screen, and without the need to go back on the Rack just to select another document.</p>

              <p>Designing the Webtrekk application was one of the the most ambitious and challenging projects I have worked on at <a href="http://impaddo.com/en/"><strong>Impaddo</strong></a>. <a href="http://www.webtrekk.com/en/products/q3.html"><strong>Webtrekk Q3</strong></a> is an amazing and tremendous web analytics system, with huge range of filters and analysis functions, and bringing it from desktop to iOS was a particularly exciting challenge.</p>
              <p>Wrangling the amount of content was no trivial pursuit. It was very important to avoid the problem of potential deep level navigation. Like always, I started by creating wireframes for every screen and state with detailed information architecture and documentation. Sketching the wireframe allowed me to quickly and easily explain the ideas behind the concept.</p>
              <p>My favorite part of the app is work done around different ways of showing graphs and tables of data and interactions designed for manipulating them.</p>

With that in mind we wanted to create the same ability in our application, but also make sure it is shaped for use on mobile devices.</p>
              <p>Early in the process we discovered which were the four most-used time periods and offered them right up front, while the rest were put one level deeper for easy find, but still out of the way.</p>

              <p>We wanted to make sure that reading and viewing articles is as enjoyable as it can be, especially on a mobile device, and we think that we succeeded in achieving our goal. Larger font size, full width images or video thumbnails are the details that make the difference, maybe invisible at first but noticeable when missing.</p>

                  <p>In attempt to avoid jumping level up and back down just to read another article, we enabled changing them just by swiping left or right. Page indicator above the text indicates which one is currently visible and difference in colors represents read articles from unread.</p>

                  <p>By putting content first, we removed all UI distractions right from the start, and only after we want to go level up we can call Back button by simply tapping anywhere on text.</p>
